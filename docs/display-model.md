# Display Model

How the devotion map decides what each constellation, star, and edge looks like.

## The Problem We Solved

Before this model, the map's visual logic was split between the SVG renderer (which CSS classes an element gets) and the stylesheet (what each class means). With multiple independent signals all setting the same property, the CSS cascade would pick one winner instead of composing them. This led to collisions where a signal was silently overwritten:

- Reachability dimming and affinity-filter fading both set `opacity`, so whichever CSS rule came last would hide the other's meaning.
- A constellation that was unreachable but matched an affinity filter could appear *brighter* than an unreachable non-match, because the lighter fade won.
- A star that was "next in my build" (attainable) looked identical to one that was "cannot reach at all" (unattainable), because both just meant "not clickable right now."

The root cause: no place computed an element's final state as a whole. Meaning was encoded in stylesheet rule ordering, which is fragile and invisible.

## The Solution: Three Independent Channels

Each element resolves three independent dimensions:

1. **Brightness** (opacity) <- attainability: "Can I get this within my remaining points?" A tri-state: active (have it), attainable (can get it), or unattainable. This channel answers that one question, so it owns the opacity property and nothing else touches it.

2. **Color** (saturation) <- affinity-filter relevance: "Does this match the active affinity filter?" Also a tri-state outcome: mute (off-filter, desaturate), match (provides a filtered color, glow in matched colors), or identity (no filter active). Color and saturation are their own channel, separate from brightness.

3. **Emphasis** (a union of additive effects) <- independent cues that genuinely stack. Active elements glow, selected elements get special styling, taken edges glow gold, search-matched stars wear half-ring arcs (one per search), a text search halos its matching constellations, compare-diff shows outlines. These are not competing for a single property; they are additive layers that coexist.

Because brightness, color, and emphasis own different channels, they combine freely. An active constellation that fails an affinity filter stays fully opaque (brightness) and self-glows (emphasis) *while* desaturating (color). You can see it is both active and off-filter. Neither signal overrides the other.

## Brightness: Attainability

Sourced from the ReachView (completable per constellation, reachableStars per star) with no changes to the resolver beneath the reachability engine.

### Constellations

- **Active**: all stars selected.
- **Attainable**: at least one star selected, OR the whole constellation fits in your remaining point budget (`completable`).
- **Unattainable**: neither of the above.

### Stars

- **Active**: selected.
- **Attainable**: in `reachableStars` - the star plus its unselected predecessors fits the remaining
  budget. This covers every unselected star of a completable constellation and the in-reach stars of
  a partially enterable one (a constellation too expensive to finish can still light the stars whose
  path fits, computed exactly by the engine's per-constellation maxK search).
- **Unattainable**: otherwise.

### Edges

- **Active**: both endpoints selected (taken).
- **Attainable**: the deeper endpoint is selected or in `reachableStars` (its path contains the
  shallower endpoint, so the whole edge sits on a reachable path).
- **Unattainable**: otherwise. Edge brightness is endpoint-level, so the lit path through a dimmed
  constellation reads star-to-star while the constellation art stays dim.

## Color: Affinity Filter

Driven by the affinity-filter signal alone. The filter is a set of desired affinities (what you want to grant or require). A constellation or star either matches the filter or it does not.

### Constellations

- **Match**: constellation provides at least one of the filtered affinities. Renders with a halo in the matched affinity colors, so the map highlights constellations that contribute to your target.
- **Mute**: constellation is active but provides none of the filtered affinities. Desaturates (loses color but keeps brightness), signaling "off your filter." Desaturation happens via SVG `feColorMatrix` saturate, not opacity, so it coexists with brightness and emphasis.
- **Identity**: no affinity filter is active. Constellation renders in its granted affinity colors (a gradient tint of what it contributes to your pool).

### Stars

Stars carry no affinity halo of their own (that is the constellation's responsibility). The affinity axis only:

- **Identity**: constellation matches the filter, OR no filter is active. Star renders normally (colored when clickable, grey when locked).
- **Mute**: constellation fails the filter. Star desaturates along with its constellation, so it reads as part of an off-filter region.

### Edges

Like stars:

- **Identity**: constellation provides a filtered color, OR no filter is active.
- **Mute**: constellation fails the filter. Edge desaturates.

## Emphasis: Additive Cues

Independent signals that stack. Never opacity:

- **Active self-glow**: an active (fully selected) constellation or edge glows in its own color, lifting the visual weight so it stands out as "I have this."
- **Selection styling**: a selected star renders with a white fill and gradient stroke, the immediate visual feedback of a click.
- **Search arcs**: a star matched by one or more active searches wears one half-ring arc per search on a track just outside its dot: the half circle centred on that search's angle, in its color. Every selected benefit tag is its own search and the text query is one more, so identity is angle first and color second: a search's arc is centred the same way on every star it marks, which survives red-green color vision deficiency and heavy zoom-out. Where two searches' half circles overlap on one star, each is cut back to the bisector between their angles, less a small seam: east and west share the ring evenly, west and southwest split their overlap at 247.5 degrees, and with more searches each arc extends toward each neighbour by half the gap, capped at a half circle. A style is a pure function of the search's slot: eight angles (north, south, east, west, then the diagonals: north and south lead because one or two searches is the common case and opposite halves read best) cycle against the five affinity orb colors (gold, blue, red, green, purple, so the map wears one palette: gold leads as the lightest, and red and green take the opposite east and west slots so the pair red-green color vision deficiency merges is always parted by direction), so the combined style stays unique for forty concurrent searches, and slots five apart (the same color) centre at least 135 degrees apart through seven concurrent searches (the eighth is the first to share a color with a 45-degree neighbour). Arc width carries the star's relative magnitude for that search (the smallest grant among the search's matches renders at base width, the largest at triple, growing outward from a fixed inner edge so the dot stays clear; text-query matches have no magnitude and stay at base). Each arc is a filled ring sector with softly rounded corners (a corner radius of three tenths of its width), so ends read as squared-off pills and seams sit exactly at the bisectors. Searches sharing an angle (slots eight apart) stack outward in slot order. Style slots are session-stable: removing a search frees only its own slot and every other search keeps its own, a new one takes the least-used free slot, and the query holds a slot like any tag while it is active (so typing never moves it) and frees it when cleared; stability while editing beats shared-link fidelity, so a fresh page load reseeds slots in canonical order, query last, and may wear different styles while marking the same searches. The same styles key the chrome: selected Benefits rows, the search box, and tagged bonus rows in the tooltip are outlined in their color and carry a mini-star swatch wearing a quarter arc centred the same way (the sidebar is the legend; an Available-to-get chip outlines when any of its ids is tagged, dashed when only some are, keyed by its first tagged id, and clicking a tagged chip clears all of its ids), and hovering one of them pulses that search's arcs on the map for about five seconds (an opacity dip, none under reduced-motion), so the legend can point at its arcs. Ordering, slot reconciliation (the query's key included), weights, and the per-star fold live in `core/searchMarks.ts` (slots only, no angles or colors, per the core discipline below); the angle and color tables, the arc path helper, and the swatch live in `adapters/markPalette.ts`; the extents, radii, and widths are the renderer's, with the outline and track look in CSS. Rendered as its own full-opacity layer under the dots, so the arcs read even on an unattainable (dim) star and a close neighbour's dot stays on top of a wide arc. When the star's constellation fails the affinity filter, the arcs are wrapped in a desaturate filter so the whole effect reads as "search match, off-filter" without the star's opacity bleeding through.
- **Power tags**: a celestial power's stats join the benefit tag vocabulary, so its diamond star lights for a tag the power grants, target debuffs included (a proc that strips 35% Chaos resistance answers the Chaos resistance tag: the aim is finding the power). The power's own effect timers are the exception: a DoT tick length or a debuff duration is not a duration bonus, so those ids never light a star for a power (`isPowerEffectDuration` in `core/statFormat.ts`, derived from the same tables the tooltip folds them into). The ones no star bonus carries are deprecated tags: kept at their URL bit position, dropped on decode, never offered on a chip (`deprecatedBenefitIds` in `core/urlState.ts`).
- **Search-match halo**: a constellation whose name or description matches the active text search glows via a `#search-glow` halo, built the same way as the affinity halo (`#aff-glow`: wide blur, stacked merge for alpha density) but flooded with the query's mark color for the render (the slot it holds), so a query hit reads the same whether it lands on a star (an arc) or a whole constellation (this halo). Mark colors are the affinity colors, so with an affinity filter and a text query both active a query halo can match a filter halo's hue; the star arcs the query always adds tell them apart and never reads as an affinity color. Like the affinity halo, its opacity respects the brightness channel (dimmer on an unattainable constellation) and it desaturates via `#mute-wide` when the constellation is muted by an affinity filter, so a search hit stays visible on an off-filter constellation instead of vanishing.
- **Compare-diff outlines**: a star added or removed in a comparison shows an outline, marking the change.
- **Taken gold**: an edge whose both endpoints are selected renders gold (the traditional grimtools style), distinct from the normal edge color.

Crucially, the affinity filter only *emphasizes* matches. It does not de-emphasize non-matches. A search-matched star in an off-filter constellation wears its arcs (search cue) and desaturates (affinity cue) *at the same time*, so you can still see it matches your target even though it is off-filter.

The halo brightness also respects the brightness channel: a matching constellation that is unattainable glows dimmer than a reachable one, so reachability still reads under an active filter.

## Architecture: Pure Core, Thin Adapter

- **Core** (`web/src/core/displayState.ts`): a pure, headless-testable module that resolves all signals for each element into a semantic record. The record carries a brightness enum (the attainability tri-state), a color outcome (the mute/match/identity flag, with match carrying its matched affinities as semantic data, not colors), and a union of emphasis flags. No presentation logic; no CSS class names; affinities as `Affinity[]` values, not hex colors; the adapter maps the brightness enum to an opacity value. No pixel numbers in the core.

- **Adapter** (`web/src/adapters/svgRenderer.ts` + `styles.css`): maps semantic records to SVG. Applies computed opacity directly as an attribute (data-driven, not via colliding CSS rules). Maps emphasis flags to SVG filter defs and classes. Resolves affinities to colors. The SVG engine rasterizes the filters. CSS applies tunable visual properties (opacity ramps, saturation strength, blur radii, stroke widths, halo colors) but no collision-prone logic.

The split ensures the map's *logic* (brightness only from attainability, affinity filter only mutes or matches, emphasis is a union) is pure and testable, while the *look* (exact opacity maps, desaturation strength, glow size) stays tweakable in CSS and the adapter without touching the core.

## What Did Not Change

- The reachability resolver and its performance path. The sweep's ReachView gained reachableStars (per-star attainability) and dropped the frontier-only clickable signal.
- The URL hash format or the `b=` selection encoding.
- The ports boundary or how the core exports data.
- Tooltips, the sidebar, or any UI outside the map rendering.
