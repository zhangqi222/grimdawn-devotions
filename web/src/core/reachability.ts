 * bound on the true min-peak (refunding a now-redundant bootstrap can only lower it), so it never
 * under-charges, which is the safe direction for dimming. Returns INF if `deficit` is uncoverable.
 *
 * Implemented as a cover-table-pruned DFS over distinct scaffolds (a used-set forbids reusing a
 * one-of-a-kind scaffold, e.g. a single crossroads, which would fabricate affinity that does not
 * exist). Scaffolds are tried high-grant-per-star first so a tight bound is found early and prunes.
